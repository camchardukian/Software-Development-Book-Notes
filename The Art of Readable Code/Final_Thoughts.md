# Final Thoughts

The *Art of Readable Code* was an interesting read. It was the first software development book I ever read, but it certainly won't be the last!

Given that I've only been working as a professional developer for a few months as of the time of reading this book (November 2019), reading *The Art of Readable Code* exposed me to some concepts that otherwise may have taken me years to discover.

I genuinely enjoyed reading this book and now intend to make reading computer science and software development books a regular habit!
