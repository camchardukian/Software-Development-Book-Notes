# Chapter 11 One Task at a Time

Boswell & Foucher open this chapter with the idea that:
> Code should be organized so that it’s doing only one task at a time.

One way we can better organize our code is by listing all of the “tasks” our code is doing. We can then separate each “task” into a different function or (section of a function). This greatly reduces, if not eliminates the amount of time we’ll spend bouncing between tasks, and also makes our code significantly more readable.
