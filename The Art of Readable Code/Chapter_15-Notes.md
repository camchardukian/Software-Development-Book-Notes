# Chapter 15 — Designing and Implementing a “Minute/Hour Counter”

In this chapter, Boswell & Foucher show what an experienced engineer’s thought process may look like in solving a real-life problem. I’ll take notes if anything stands out, or if there’s anything I think is worth reviewing.

— If your function is named after a word that could be both a noun or a verb, and a misinterpretation could be costly, it may be best to rename said function.

— Asking for an outsider’s perspective is a great way to test if your code is user-friendly.

— We should generally strive to structure our code so that in a production environment, our application uses a small, predictable amount of memory.
