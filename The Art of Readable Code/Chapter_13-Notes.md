# Chapter 13 Writing Less Code

Boswell & Foucher open this chapter with the idea that knowing what *not* to code is one of the most important important skills a programmer can learn because every line of code that you write is a line that needs to be tested and maintained.

— Another point made in this chapter is that most programmers get overexcited to implement new features and underestimate how much of a time commitment implementing a requirement really takes (because they forget about unexpected issues, future maintenance, documentation, etc).

— Part of being a great developer is scrutinizing requirements carefully to know exactly which features are essential to the application, and which requirements can be removed.

Solving simple problems is exponentially easier than solving difficult problems. Thus, while we may only be able to remove 25% of the requirements or “difficulty factor” from a task, said task could then potentially be 50% easier.

— The larger a codebase grows, the more difficult it becomes to work with. Thus, it’s recommended to keep one’s codebase as small as possible.

— The authors suggest occasionally spending 15 minutes or so reading through your library’s documentation to expose yourself to each function/module/type in your library.

Their belief is that doing this from time to time will deepen your knowledge of your library, and in the future you’ll be more likely to think to use existing snippets of code from your library (because you’ve been recently exposed to them) rather than trying to unnecessarily develop a new solution from scratch.
