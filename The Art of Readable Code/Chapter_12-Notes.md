# Chapter 12 Turning Thoughts into Code

Explaining a complex idea to someone often requires distilling that idea into its most fundamental points and then explaining those fundamentals in plain English.

Similarly, our code is how we present our program’s logic to other programmers, and thus we should also strive to write our code from pillars of “plain English”.

That’s my interpretation of the key idea Boswell & Foucher are trying to get across with this chapter.

— The authors suggest that being aware of what your library/framework can and cannot do contributes greatly to being able to write succinct code.

— The authors repeatedly show that writing pseudocode to describe what our code is trying to achieve is a great way to develop higher quality solutions to problems.

— There is one college computer lab that has a policy that requires student’s to first explain their problem to a dedicated teddy bear in the corner of the room whenever they need help debugging.

Surprisingly, just describing their problem aloud helps many students discover solutions or holes in their logic. This practice of describe a problem aloud is referred to as “rubber ducking”.

Basically, the idea is that if you can’t clearly describe the flow of your program in words, you’ve probably left something out, used something incorrectly, or forgotten to give something a value.
