I wish I would've read _Pro Git_ before I'd started working as a full-time software developer. Doing so would've given me one less thing to worry about trying to learn ASAP as a junior developer.

With that being said, even with over a year of experience under my belt I still thought there was lots of great information in this book.

Though there was a lot of information in this book I don't expect to be useful for a long time, if ever (plumbing commands for example), _Pro Git_ definitely strengthened my knowledge of Git.

I'm now much more confident using _git reset_ than I previously was, and it was also insightful to learn about tools like _git reflog_.

It was interesting to learn about how configurable Git is and learn about some interesting configuration options like _rerere_.

Overall, I'd recommend _Pro Git_ to any developer looking to gain a deeper understanding of Git. I _don't_, however,think it's necessary to read this book cover to cover like I did though.

Some chapters such as the _Git Tools_ one were disproportionately more useful.
