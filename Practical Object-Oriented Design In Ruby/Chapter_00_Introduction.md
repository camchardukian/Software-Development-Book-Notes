# Introduction

Metz believes that programmers write software to produce something meaningful and have fun along the way. Unfortunately, bad software practices and getting “stuck” can make us feel like the cost of doing our work exceeds the value produced by it.

Metz’s goal with this book is to help us become more productive software developers and write code that brings us joy rather than frustration.

Metz recommends that novices adhere to the principles of Object Oriented Design (OOD) presented in this book in blind faith if necessary.

She believes that once said novices gain enough experience, they can then begin to challenge commonly established principles and make their own decisions.
