# Final Thoughts From Cameron

I felt _Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby_ was a solid book for learning about Object-Oriented design. In addition, this book also offers a lot of advice that extends far beyond the realm of OOP.

For example, any developer would benefit from learning more about the SOLID principles, DRY, and the Law of Demeter.

This book also really hammered on the importance of ensuring we model our application in such a way that it meets current requirements while also being easy to change later on.

I loved that this book really helped me more deeply understand the differences between inheritance and composition as well as when we should use one over the other.

More than anything else, this book went beyond simply offering object-oriented guidelines. The example refactoring and fixing journeys we went on offered great insights into the process of how our designs and models may need to change as we gather more requirements and our application grows.
