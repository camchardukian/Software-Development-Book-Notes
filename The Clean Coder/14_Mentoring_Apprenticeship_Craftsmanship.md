# Chapter 14 - Mentoring, Apprenticeship, and Craftsmanship

Martin argues that we should place a greater emphasis on having the “elders” of the programming world mentor the newer entrants via a journey of apprenticeship and gradually giving them more responsibility and autonomy over time.

He also writes that the best way to create more professional developers in the future, more “craftsmen” is for us older developers to act as role models for the future generations.
