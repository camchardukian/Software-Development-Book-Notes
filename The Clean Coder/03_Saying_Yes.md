# Chapter 3 — Saying Yes

## A Language of Commitment

Non-commitment often uses words like hope, wish, should, and let’s.

We can look for real commitment on the other hand by looking out for sentences that sound more like this, “I will finish \_\_\_ by \_\_\_.”

By stating what we as an individual plan to do by a clear end time, in the future there will be a clear binary result that we either lived up to our promise or didn’t.

We can only commit to things that we have full control of. We can’t commit to things where we’re relying on other people to get things done.

What we can do, however, is commit to specific actions like setting up time to discuss dependencies with other teams, or eliminating our dependencies on other teams (when possible).

## Learning How to Say “Yes”

If we can’t commit to meeting a deadline it’s better not to use the word ‘try’.

> I’ll try to complete it by Friday.

It’s better to push back about how long something will take to complete, or at least be more explicit about the likelihood of being able to complete something.

> I won’t be able to complete the feature by Friday. It’s possible it’ll be finished on Monday, but the delivery may be as late as Tuesday.

Overall, professionals are not required to say yes to everything that is asked of them, but they should put in effort to try to find creative ways to make “yes” possible.

That may mean asking for additional support from others, asking to rearrange their working schedule, or seeing if it’s possible to reduce the required specifications for a given release or delivery.
