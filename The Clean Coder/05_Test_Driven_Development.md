# Chapter 5 - Test Driven Development

Here are the three laws of TDD:

1. You are not allowed to write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test.
2. You are not allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail â€” and not compiling is failing.
3. You are not allowed to write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test.
