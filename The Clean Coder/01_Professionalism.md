# Chapter 1 — Professionalism

## Responsibility

Professionalism is all about taking responsibility. Though that can be a bit scary, even scarier is having to suffer through the consequences of not taking responsibility.

The first principle of taking responsibility is to do no harm. What does this mean?

The first aspect of this is to be accountable for our errors and strive for perfection even though errors are virtually certain. Moreover, we should apologize for any errors or bugs we do create.

Our goal should be that our QA team doesn’t find any bugs. Though this can be unrealistic at times, it's still a good target to shoot for.

While manual testing exists for a reason, our automated tests should at least tell us that our system is very likely to pass manual QA.

## Work Ethic

Our career is our responsibility, not our employer’s.

A good baseline to rapidly develop ourselves professionally is to work for our employer 40 hours per week and then dedicate an additional 20 hours per week trying to improve our skills.
