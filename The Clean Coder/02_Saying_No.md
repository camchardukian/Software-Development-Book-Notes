# Saying No

## High Stakes

The higher the stakes, the more valuable being able to say, “no” becomes.

A professional must be willing to give managers the best information they can, and that often means saying no.

## Being a “Team Player”

A “team player” is not someone who always says yes.

A real team player is someone who is realistic about what can and cannot be accomplished if they perform to the best of their ability.

A real team player is unwilling to commit to unrealistic demands and deadlines.

## The Cost of Saying Yes

There’s a formula that software engineers should be aware of about how stakeholders try to get their developers to write code quickly:

1. Tell the developer the app is simple.
1. Add features by faulting the team for not recognizing their necessity.
1. Push the deadline. Over and over.

Although this strategy doesn’t result in getting engineers to write the most effective code, it sure is effective in getting them to _try_ to write twice the amount of code in half the time.

As such, this is a strategy we should be aware of to prevent ourselves from overcommitting.
