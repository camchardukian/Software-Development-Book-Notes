# Chapter 12 - Collaboration

## Programmers vs People

Many programmers became programmers because they find interpersonal relationships messy and unpredictable and they like the clean and predictable behavior of the machines that we program.

It’s a generalization but programmers do tend to lean in this direction.

## Programmers versus Employers

Programmers don’t necessarily need to be passionate about the business, but they do need to understand the business and its goals.

## Programmers versus Programmers

It’s almost always more effective for a team to own the code than for each individual developer to build walls around his/her code and refuse to let others see/touch their code.

Another way for programmers to collaborate more effectively is to pair program. Apart from pair programming being the best way to solve difficult problems, it also prevents knowledge silos.
