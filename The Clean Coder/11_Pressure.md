# Chapter 11 - Pressure

The best way to stay calm under pressure is to avoid situations that cause pressure.

One way to do this is to avoid committing to deadlines that we aren’t sure we can meet.

Another way to avoid pressure is to keep our systems, code, and design as clean as possible.

Professionals developers understand that messes slow us down, thus part of being a professional is not tolerating messes.

When we can’t avoid pressure, the best way to handle it is by staying calm, communicating, continuing to follow best practices, and seeking help from others.
