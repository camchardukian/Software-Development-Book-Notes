# Chapter 10 - Estimation

## What is an Estimate?

Is an estimate a commitment or a guess? That depends on who you ask. Businesses typically view estimates as commitments whereas developers usually view estimates as best guesses.

Part of being a professional is communicating the difference between the average or most likely amount of time a task will take, and the amount of time you commit or guarantee to finishing the task in.

One thing we can do to improve our estimates is give them in percentages using an optimistic, average, and realistic worst-case scenario.

Thereâ€™s a 20% chance the task can be finished in 3 days, 60% chance the task can be finished in 5 days, and 99% chance the task can be finished in 10 days.

## Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)

PERT uses statistical formula that incorporates a wildly optimistic estimate <1%, a nominal estimate, and a wildly pessimistic estimate <1% into a formula to generate a fairly conservative estimate of how long something will take.

## Estimating Tasks

Estimations via consensus are usually more accurate than estimations made by individuals.

Consensus estimates can be quickly generated via different games/exercises such as _flying fingers_, _planning poker_, _silent sorting_, etc.

The important thing is to have discussions when members are unable to reach consensus about how long tasks should take.
