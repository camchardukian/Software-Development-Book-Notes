# Chapter 13 - Teams and Projects

A “gelled” team usually consists of around a dozen people and should be composed of programmers, testers, analysts, and a project manager.

The ratio of programmers to testers and analysts can vary, but 2:1 is a good rule of thumb.

In short, a nicely gelled team could consist of 7 programmers, 2 testers, 2 analysts, and a project manager.

Here are some tasks the non-dev team members may take on:

**Analysts** - Develop requirements and write automated acceptance tests that focus mostly on happy paths and business value.

**Testers** - Write automated acceptance tests, but pay more attention to what may go wrong and write the failure and boundary cases.

**Project Manager** - Tracks the progress of the team and makes sure the team understands the schedules and priorities.

Martin argues that one weakness of banks and insurance companies is that they often try to form teams around projects.

The problem with this is that it doesn’t give team members enough time to learn how to work with each other most effectively.

Instead, gelled teams should be given multiple projects. Apart from giving members the chance to learn to work together in the most effective way possible, this structure also allows the team to shift on a dime if necessary..

The team can give project “A” or project “C” 100% of its effort for short periods of time during emergencies whereas project based teams would have no chance of being able to shift that quickly onto another project during emergency situations.
