# Chapter 9 - Time Management

## Meetings

Professionals have an obligation to spend their employer’s time wisely, and if someone cannot contribute meaningfully to a meeting or gain relevant awareness or knowledge, they should try to negotiate their exit.

To make meetings more effective, meetings should have a clear agenda with times for each topic and a stated goal.

Mr. Martin suggests that if one can’t get a clear answer for what discussions are on the table, how much time is allotted for them, and what goal is to be achieved, then it’s probably best to politely decline said meeting.

## Arguments/Disagreements

Technical arguments that cannot be resolved within 5-30 meetings are a clear indication that continuing to argue won’t resolve said argument.

The only way to resolve these arguments is to either choose randomly via coin flip or preferably gather data via experiments, simulations or modeling so that the data can decide for itself.

## Focus

Once your reserve of daily willpower or ability to concentrate has depleted, it’s difficult if not impossible to force yourself to focus.

This doesn’t mean you can’t continue to write code, but it’s likely that you’ll write something of subpar quality that will need to be rewritten the next day.

Engaging in a regular exercise program or doing something physical like carpentry or gardening can be useful for increasing your long-term concentration reserves and also help you replenish them in the short-term.

## Messes

Sometimes you create a clean solution to a simple problem, but as the problem grows in scope and complexity you try to extend your codebase and keep your solution as clean as you can.

Unfortunately, at some point you realize you made an incorrect design choice when you started and that your code doesn’t scale well with the new requirements.

This is the critical period where you must decide whether to go back and fix the design of your solution or power forward.

Going back may look expensive because you’ll have to rework the existing code, but going back will never be easier than it is now so it’s usually the right choice to go back because you'll avoid contributing to a system that'll have far more messes in the future.
