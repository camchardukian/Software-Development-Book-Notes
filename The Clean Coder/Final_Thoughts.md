# Final Thoughts

_The Clean Coder_ is a phenomenal book about what it means to be a true professional as a software developer.

It's not an overly technical book so it can be a great read for students, or even those who work with developers that simply want to better understand the developers they work with.

It's also a great read for intermediate developers who want to learn more about the soft skills that will allow them to function as effective senior and lead developers.
