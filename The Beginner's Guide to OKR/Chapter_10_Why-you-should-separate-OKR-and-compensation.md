# Chapter 10 — Why you should separate OKR and compensation

OKRs are about an organization’s goals and how each employee contributes to said goals. Performance evaluations on the other hand should be focused only on an individual’s performance during a given time period.

Having OKRs attached to compensation can reward employees for negotiating less ambitious goals rather than rewarding employees for actually performing well.

A study conducted by Willis Towers Watson also suggests that regular pay for performance tools are not effective at driving improved performance.

Castro suggests that if an organization is going to attach achievement of goals to the performance evaluation process, the organization should judge goal achievement much like gymnastics.

While the percentage of goals achieved is important, the difficulty of the goals and the impact these goals may have on the company are perhaps even more important! All of these factors need to be included in a weighted score.

In any case, it’s almost always unwise for an organization to change its compensation model before its usage of OKR has matured.
