# Chapter 11 — Common OKR mistakes

This chapter is basically just a list of the 8 most common mistakes Castro has observed with organizations trying to implement OKR.

Those mistakes according to Castro are as follows:

1. Setting non-measurable Key Results.
1. Too many OKRs or Key Results.
1. Including tasks as Key Results.
1. Setting OKRs top-down.
1. Creating OKRs in silos
(Note from Cam: Castro is simply referring to team’s creating OKRs in isolation without communicating with other teams).
1. “Set it and Forget it”.
1. Including OKRs in a compensation formula.
1. Trying to copy Google blindly (Note from Cam: The principles of OKR should be understood and adapted to fit your organization’s specific needs).
