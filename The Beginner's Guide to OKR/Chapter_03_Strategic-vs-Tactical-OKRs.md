# Chapter 3 — Strategic vs. Tactical OKRs: Nested Cadences

While OKRs are most commonly used with a quarterly cycle, it is a misconception that OKRs can only be set on a quarterly basis.

Most successful adoptions of OKR use annual strategic OKRs for the company (and possibly for very large departments/business units), quarterly tactical OKRs for the teams (with a mid-quarter review), and weekly check-ins for tracking results.

When OKRs are set extremely frequently, it becomes important to have processes to set OKRs quickly to avoid spending too much time setting goals.

Likewise, if operating in a market that changes on an extremely rapid basis, long OKR cycles will be of little help to an organization.

For simplicity, the author recommends using quarterly tactical OKRs in the beginning for most companies and adapting as needed later on.

While different parts of an organization can use different OKR cycles (for example the sales team sets 4 month OKRs while the engineering team sets quarterly OKRs), in general the author recommends using intervals such that the different parts of the organization have as many “synchronization” opportunities as possible.
