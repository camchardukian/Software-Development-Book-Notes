# Chapter 9 — A Typical OKR Cycle

In this chapter, Castro describes a common OKR cycle as consisting of the following steps:

1. Company defines a set of high-level strategic OKRs, preferably with input from all levels of the organization.

1. The executive team validates the company OKRs, while gathering feedback from the team in the process.

1. Teams develops their tactical OKRs.

1. Teams map interdependencies and ensure they are in alignment with other teams.

1. Teams have weekly check-ins to track results/initiatives.

1. Review OKRs halfway through the quarter (or halfway through whatever the duration of the OKR is).

1. Have a quick retrospective/lessons learned meeting.

1. Repeat the process.

For the OKR retrospective, it’s recommended teams use a start-stop-continue format to label things they should start/stop/continue doing.
