# Chapter 5 â€” Success criteria and types of Key Results

Every individual and every organization needs a definition of what it means to be successful.

In most organizations, each team member would probably give a different answer for what it means to be successful.

Furthermore, they may not even have metrics to definitively say whether said idea of success has been achieved.

OKRs remedy both of the above problems by defining measurable shared success criteria.

With that being said, just having measurable shared success criteria isn't enough.

It's important that we don't turn our OKRs into a task list.

There is a fairly simple way to focus on producing results rather than spinning our wheels aimlessly like we are hamsters; we need to set key results that are focused on values rather than activities.

Activity based key results usually measure the completion of tasks/activities or the delivery of project milestones/deliverables; developing a new lead generation campaign or releasing a beta version of a product for example.

Value based key results on the other hand measure the delivery of value to the organization or its customers. 

In other words, this type of key result measures the **resulting outcome produced by the completion of activities!**

Here are some examples:
* Maintain customer acquisition cost under Y.

* Decrease bounce rate of website from X% to Y%.

* Increase organic traffic from X to Y.

Castro recommends writing key results using an X (where we begin) to Y (what we want to achieve) structure.

This is more effective than a percentage structure because the ambitiousness of our endeavors are more clearly defined.

Increasing the quantity of unit tests we've written for a project by 30% is very different based on whether we're going from 10 to 13, or 100 to 130.

Finally, it needs to be stressed again how important it is to set OKRs that are based on value and NOT merely activities.

Here are the 3 main reasons:

1. We want a results-focused culture, and not one focused on tasks.

1. If you did all of your tasks and nothing improved, that is not success.

1. Your action plan is just a series of hypotheses.

To elaborate on the final point, we can never be sure of exactly what changes will occur based on the activities we partake in.

We can never be sure if or how the actions we take will improve our results or add value to the organization.

As such, it makes more sense to focus on the destination rather than how we're planning to get there. Otherwise, it's easy to fall back into trap #2 of completing all of our tasks but nothing improving.

With that out of the way, let's talke about initiatives. Initiatives are the projects, tasks or activities we are going to do to achieve our OKRs.

Once again, while it's important to track the delivery of initiatives, it's also important to always remember that behind every initiative is a desire to improve one or more metrics.

Here's a simple structure Castro recommends using to always remind yourself of the greater importance of the metrics that lie behind any given activity:
```
If we are successful with (this initiative),we will
(Key Result #1)
(Key Result #2)
(Key Result #3)
```
*Aaaaand*, to chapter 6 we go!
