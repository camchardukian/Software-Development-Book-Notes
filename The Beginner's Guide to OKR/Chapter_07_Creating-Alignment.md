# Chapter 7 — Creating Alignment


A common mistake organizations make when implementing OKR is the creation of OKRs in isolation.

One common problem that occurs when setting OKRs in isolation (without talking to other teams/divisions of the company) is defining OKRs that are overly optimistic due to misaligned expectations regarding the amount of time needed by a third party to deliver a required action.

When implemented properly, the OKR system uses several different mechanisms to align different teams in an organization.

## Transparency
Because each team’s OKRs are visible, if one team’s OKRs are not aligned with other parts of the organization, these other teams can easily point out this fact.

## Shared OKRs
Shared OKRs can also be used to create alignment between multiple teams/divisions. When sharing OKRs amongst teams, the teams share a single objective but set different initiatives. The teams can also meet regularly to sync their progress, and track results/initiatives for the duration of the shared OKR.

## 360 Degree Alignment

Unlike the cascading (top-down) approach to setting goals, OKR focuses on 360 degree alignment (top, down, and sideways). When teams are interdependent on each other, they can set shared OKRs.

If teams cannot create shared OKRs at a given time, it may also be possible to delay certain initiatives to a later date when both teams are better able to coordinate their efforts.
