# Chapter 1 — What is OKR?

**OKR** is an acronym that stands for *Objectives and Key Results*. This goal setting system was originally created by Intel and later grew in popularity with other Silicon Valley companies.

While perhaps most ubiquitous amongst software companies, **OKR** can be used by companies in any industry. 

The big reason the **OKR** method of goal setting is different from traditional planning methods is simple — frequency. **OKRs** are typically set, measured, and re-evaluated on a quarterly basis.

Here’s the basic formula for how to write an **OKR**: I will (Objective) as measured by (this set of Key Results).

Let’s quickly define *Objectives* and *Key Results*.

*Objectives* are short, inspiring descriptions of what we want to achieve. *Objectives* should both motivate and challenge our team.

*Key Results* are the set of metrics we use to measure progress towards our Objective. It’s recommended that for each Objective we have a short list of 2-5 *Key Results*.

Quality over quantity is key here as having too many* Key Result*s here will result in nobody being able to remember all of them.

It’s also important to note that all *Key Results* should be accompanied by some quantitative number. A former Google Vice President once said,
>“If it does not have a number, it is not a Key Result.”

Here are some of the core concepts that make **OKR** unique:

**Agile Goals** — The **OKR** system utilizes shorter goal cycles than annual planning. As a result, companies that use **OKR** have an easier time responding to change compared to companies that rely on annual plans.

**Simplicity** — **OKRs** are easy to understand and can be set quickly. As a result, organizations can spend less time setting goals and more time actually working on our goals.

**Transparency** — **OKRs** are typically made public to all levels of the company to increase alignment within the organization.

**Nested Cadences** — It’s possible, and even recommended to set **OKRs** at different intervals. For example, a company may have longer-term strategic **OKRs** set annually, tactical **OKRs** set quarterly, and a system for tracking results weekly.

**Bidirectional Goal Setting** — Because a large portion of the **OKRs** are set by team members, **OKRs** mostly avoid the traditional top-down goal setting model that is overly time consuming. In addition, because most **OKRs** come from the teams themselves, individual members are more engaged with the goals of the team.

**Ambitious Goals** — **OKR** targets ambitious goals. Goals should not be reached with a 100% success rate. Teams should be enabled to set challenging goals that require them to rethink they way they work in order to reach peak performance.

**Decoupling Rewards** — **OKRs** should be separated from compensation and promotions. A failure to separate these two things will prevent employees from being inclined to set ambitious goals. In short, **OKR** is a management tool and NOT a tool for directly evaluating employees.

Finally, here are some quick tips for writing good **OKRs**:

*Objectives* should be short enough that they are easy to memorize while also being worded in a way that fits your company culture (slang or profanity may be permitted for example if such language fits the company culture).

*Key Results* should separate metrics from tasks, and any objective should have 2-5 *Key Results*.
