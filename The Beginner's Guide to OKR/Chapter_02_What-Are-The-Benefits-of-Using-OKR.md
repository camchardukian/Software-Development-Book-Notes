# Chapter 2 — What are the Benefits of Using OKR?

This very short chapter simply brings up the main advantages of using OKR. The benefits discussed are as follows:

## Agility
Basically, shorter goal cycles allow for faster adjustments and an improved ability to adapt to a rapidly changing business environment.

## Alignment and cross-functional cooperation
Teams across an organization can better collaborate with each other through the shared usage of OKRs.

## Reduced time for setting goals
The simplicity of OKR can greatly reduce the amount of time and resources spent on setting goals.

## Clear communication
The simplicity and transparency offered by OKRs enables each time to see how they can contribute to the organization as well as how each individual can contribute to their particular team.

## Employee engagement
The bottom-up approach of setting goals increases employees’ engagement by connecting them with company objectives.

## Autonomy and accountability
While teams have a clearly defined OKR to hold them accountable, they are given the freedom to determine the best way of accomplishing their OKR.

## Focus and discipline
Having a smaller quantity of goals allows individuals in an organization to more aggressively pursue their goals.

## Bolder goals
By using OKRs as a management tool instead of a tool for evaluating employees, teams are encouraged to set more challenging goals for themselves.
