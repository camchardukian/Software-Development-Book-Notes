# Chapter 6 — How ambitious should your OKRs be?

In Google’s “[Ten things we know to be true](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html)” manifesto, the tech giant emphasizes the importance of setting ambitious goals by saying:
> “We set ourselves goals we know we can’t reach yet, because we know that by stretching to meet them we can get further than we expected.”

A few key characteristics that define stretch goals are that they:

* Take you out of your comfort zone.

* Make you go after targets that you think you can’t reach (at least not yet.

* Make you achieve things you couldn’t do before.

* Should be hard but not so hard as to harm (or demotivate) you.

The founder of Google, Larry Page, believes that bold goals are a key to helping people think big.

If someone is achieving all of the goals they set for themselves, they haven’t set goals that are ambitious enough. 

Realistically, an organization or individual has done well if they’ve achieved around 60-70% of their stretch goals.

At the same time, it’s important that we don’t become complacent with achieving *only* 70% of our goals/OKRs.

We need to maintain the discipline to try to achieve 100% of our goals, even though most of the time we will “fall short”.

Castro explains that their are two types of OKRs:

## Moonshots
* Stretch goals.
* Just beyond the threshold of what seems possible.
* Success means achieving 60-70%.

## Roofshots
* Goals that are hard but achievable.
* Success means achieving 100%.

Castro also explains that while moonshots are an important foundational building block of OKR, they also have the potential to cause some problems.

For one moonshots may demotivate individuals/teams that are used to achieving 100% of their goals. Moonshots can also be misunderstood and result in some members of the organization thinking that reaching moonshots isn’t important because they were just “stretch goals” anyway.

Finally, moonshots can cause dependency issues between teams. One team may be unable to do something because they haven’t received the moonshot deliverable from another team.

As such, Castro recommends organizations start with using solely roofshots, and only incorporating moonshots once the organization has developed a strong results-focused culture.

He also suggests that OKRs can be set using one moonshot key result per OKR. It seems that he believes doing so can encourage teams/individuals to stretch themselves, while still trying to develop a habit of regularly achieving their goals.
