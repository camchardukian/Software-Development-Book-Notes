# Final Thoughts From Cameron

As I'm writing this in April 2020, I have now been a full-time software developer for a little over 8 months.

Just last week, we set goals for what I believe was the start of my 3rd OKR cycle.

The first couple times around I found the OKR meetings to be a bit boring.

It wasn't entirely clear to me what the point of my team setting an OKR was when we basically in Castro's words, "Set it and forget it".

*The Beginner's Guide to OKR* has given me some great actionable steps we can take to improve our implementation of OKR at my company; adding weekly check-ins for instance.

This book has also given me lots of ideas that I can share with my teammates during our next OKR meeting.

I expect the knowledge I've gained from reading this book will benefit me for the duration of my career in software development, and even beyond it as well! :D
