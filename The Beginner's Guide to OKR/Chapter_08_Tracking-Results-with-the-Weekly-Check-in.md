# Chapter 8 — Tracking Results with the Weekly Check-in

Everyone knows the experience of setting New Year’s resolutions with good intentions, and then completely forgetting about them.

Likewise, it’s very easy to forget about our OKRs if we do not regularly check-in on them.

That may be why Castro suggests that weekly check-ins are the most powerful tool an organization has to ensure OKRs become (or remain) a part of the company’s culture.

Unfortunately, just showing up to weekly OKR check-ins isn’t enough. We also need to come to these meetings with the right mindset.

Traditionally, most company meetings are focused on putting out fires. For our weekly OKR check-ins, however, we should instead focus on improving results.

Once again, our mental energy should be focused on finding solutions to how we can improve rather than listing explanations or excuses for any disappointing results we may have.

Castro also believes that we should skip scoring during our weekly check-ins to avoid adding unnecesssary complexity and the fact that,
> “Scoring brings almost no benefits if you are using Value-based Key Results.”

Finally, according to Castro, the optimal weekly OKR check-in includes the four elements described below:

## OKR Progress
**What changed in the Key Results since the last Check-in?**

This element is fairly self-explanatory, the team discusses the current measure of each Key Result, and how far the team has come since the last meeting.

## Confidence Levels
**With the information we have today, how confident are we that we will reach each Key Result?**

While the OKR progress element offers quantitative data, the confidence levels reported by a team bring qualitative data. Castro recommends using either the traffic light scale (green, yellow, red) or the emoticon sale (happy, concerned, sad).

**Green/Happy** — We expect to reach it.

**Yellow/Concerned** — There is a risk we will not reach it, but we believe we can do it.

**Red/Sad** — We do not believe we will reach it unless we take a new approach.

The conversation surrounding confidence is extremely important because it can be used to align the team and assess how engaged each team member is. 

It’s also important to note that a Key Result being evaluated as Red/Sad doesn’t mean the team should give up. It DOES mean, however, that the team should change its approach.

## Impediments
**What is slowing down the team?**

Self-explanatory.

## Initiatives
**What are we going to do to improve results?**

Self-explanatory.
