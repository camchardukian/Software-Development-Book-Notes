# Chapter 4 — OKRs do not Cascade

Traditionally, organizations have used a cascading goal setting model.

One issue that occurs when setting goals in this manner, however, is that each person must wait for their supervisor/superior to set a goal before they are able to set their own goals.

This is extremely time consuming — some global corporations are known to take as long as 4-6 months to set goals using this process!

For that reason, Castro (the author of this book) states that goals should not cascade — they should align.

The organization can set company OKRs, and from those individual teams can determine how they can best contribute to reaching those OKRs.

Because OKRs are viewable by all members of an organization, it is easy enough to see if any teams have tactical OKRs that are grossly out of alignment with what the company is striving to achieve.

Castro states that tactical key results set by a team may be:
```
“A slice of the company OKR (Ex: The company will sell 100, my team will sell 20).

“Hypotheses or bets about how to contribute to the Strategic OKRs (Ex: We will reduce the number of customer complaints because we believe it will increase the repurchase rate).”
```
Teams can also have “local” OKRs that aren’t directly related to the company’s strategic OKRs, but most tactical OKRs should relate to the strategic OKRs.

Another general guideline is that around 60% of OKRs should be defined by the team bottom-up.
