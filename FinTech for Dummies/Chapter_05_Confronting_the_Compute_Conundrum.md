# Chapter 5 — Confronting the Compute Conundrum

## Determining Compute Requirements

In FinTech, _capacity planning_ refers to estimating the required strength of hardware and software needed for a bank’s processing needs.

Factors such as volume, velocity, veracity and variety can influence these processing needs.

## In-memory Computing

While not a new concept, In-memory computing has grown increasingly popular recently because of the decreasing cost of RAM.

## Virtualization

Virtualization can reduce costs via the elimination of physical machines and provide increased scalability and efficiency.

## Making Sense of DApps

Not all decentralized applications are blockchains, but blockchains are certainly the most well-known form of DApps.

In traditional apps there is a single “source of truth” whereas in DApps there isn’t a single location or entity that holds “the truth”.

A decentralized data structure (DDS) is revolutionary because it remove this central control, and instead operates on a consensus model.

Here are some of the current pros and cons of DApps…

**Pros:**

- Minimal transaction costs
- High transparency
- Immutable data
- Excellent security

**Cons:**

- Poor scalability
- Unfriendly UI
- Steep learning curve

## Blockchain

Blockchains are a type of _decentralized data structure_ (DDS). Some of the benefits of blockchain are that it is:

- Peer-to-peer with no 3rd parties
- Anonymous
- Secure
- Distributed
- Based on changes adhering to strict protocols

## DApps, Artificial Intelligence, and FinTech

Going forward DApps along with _artificial intelligence_ (AI) are expected to speed up banking operations, while also decreasing the need for human intervention.

## Looking at Permissioned Blockchain

Permissioned blockchains may offer more efficient performance and comfort (to corporations) but they also come with serious downsides:

- They reduce/eliminate anonymity
- They are more likely to face security breaches or have data manipulated

## Understanding Quantum Computing

Quantum computers operate on strings of quantum bits called _quibits_. Quibits can spin vertically and horizontally at the same time.

Quibits can be used to represent different possible states.

## The Drawbacks of Quantum Computing

There is an inherent level of inaccuracy that accompanies quantum computing, but a quantum app could be run multiple times to obtain an answer that is statistically probable.

## How Quantum Computing Fits into FinTech

One of quantum computing’s most prominent use cases is for quantifying _value at risk_ (VaR) or _conditional value at risk_ (CVaR).
