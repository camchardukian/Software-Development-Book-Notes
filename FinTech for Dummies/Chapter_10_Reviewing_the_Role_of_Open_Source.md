# Chapter 10 â€” Reviewing the Role of Open Source

Over the past several years a number of changes have occured that have led to the greater usage of open source software by FinTech companies:

- Agile is now more commonly used than waterfall
- Teams are increasingly composed of millenials who have different attitudes about security and ownership.
- Companies want fast solutions without being locked into a specific product or vendor.

## Looking at Open Source Development Process

The motivation behind starting an open source project is often different than the motivation behind developing a traditional software project.

Open source projects are often started just because of the curiosity of a developer rather than any specific and immediate business need.

_Open Source Software (OSS)_ typically utilizes the concept of release early and often.

## Perusing the Pros & Cons of Open Source

**Pros:**

- Decreased hardware and software cost
- Increased employee utilization
- No reinvention of the wheel
- Better testiung and product control
- Increase in speed of development and more frequent releases
- Cutting-edge technology can be cost-effectively delivered in areas that aren't core to the company's main business

**Cons:**

- An untraditional support model where the developer(s) have no obligation to offer continued support or maintenance
- No customer representative, and thus few if any reminders of the need to upgrade and the potential risks of using out-of-date products
- Potential security risks ranging from legal to operational to viral
- Potential licensing issues, especially when comingling proprietary code with open source code
