# Chapter 3 — The Role of Regulation in FinTech

The financial crises of 2008 and alleged abuses caused by a “too big to fail” culture have led to increased regulations in the financial sector.

## Leveling the Playing Field

“BigTech” refers to enormous companies such as Google that provide products and services across multiple industries.

During their early days or even before they are founded, FinTech firms should focus on researching what regulatory approvals they may need in order to continue operating.

## Introducing the Regulators

The U.S. is known for being a jurisdiction that follow a rules-based approach whereas the U.K. tends to follow a principles-based approach.

Some would argue that this gives the U.K. an advantage as technology is changing so fast that the implementation of specific rules cannot keep pace with the speed of innovation and change.

Some of the most important regulatory bodies in the US include:

- The Federal Reserve
- The Financial Stability Oversight Council
- The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
- The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
- The Commodity Futures Trading Commission

_The Global Financial Innovation Network_ (GFIN) was created to promote harmonization and standardization across FinTech firms globally.

## Investigating Regulatory Changes

The 1st _Payment Services Directive_ (PSD 1) in 2009 added responsibilities and prudential requirements in order to be a payment service provider (PSP).

PSD 2 in 2018 allowed for regulatory approval in a single E.U. country to be passport across other E.U. countries.

## The General Data Protection Regulation

The _General Data Protection Regulation_ (GDPR) is a set of rules introduced in 2018 that govern who can access data of individuals living in the E.U. and in what ways. These rules apply to all companies that process the data of E.U. residents regardless of where the companies are located.
