# Chapter 8 â€” Acclimating to the App Mentality

## Introducing Types of FinTech Apps

**Web Apps** -- Stored on and run from web servers. Users don't have to download anything to run them.

**Native apps** -- An app developed to run on only one kind of device or platform.

**Mobile app** -- Usually native apps designed for a specific mobile operating system (OS).

**Hybrid app** -- Acts like a native app in that it must be downloaded, but is written in a standard development language like HTML or Java.

**Killer apps** -- Native apps that are so compelling and unique that they drive users to become loyal to the specific platform on which they run. For example if Pokemon Go was only available on iOS it may drive people from Android to iOS just to play.

**Legacy apps** -- Apps that may no longer be supported or built for outdated platforms or built using obsolete technologies. They continue to exist because they serve a specific function that may be too expensive or difficult to recreate.

## Building a GUI Framework

The most successful Fintech apps are intuitive to use and tend to be graphical in nature.

For example, they often present a dashboard view of the most critical information the user needs when first opening the app.

### Introducing the GUI

Because it's possible to log every interaction customers have/make, companies can mine that data to identify how good of a customer experience they are offering.

### Establishing the Requirements Needed in the Development of an App

These days business requirements drive the app development process.

Complex apps can have their requirements modeled using a _unique modeling language (UML)_ diagram.
