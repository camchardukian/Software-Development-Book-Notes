# Chapter 9 â€” Breaking Down BI Tools

_Business Intelligence (BI)_ is the coordinated use of technologies, processes, and architectures used to mine, transform, and analyze raw business data to help make intelligent business decisions.

A _management information system (MIS)_ is an IT system that aggregates, processes, analyzes, and organizes data across an entire company and a larger industrial base, directly improving operational and financial outcomes.

## Exploring BI Tools

Some of the technologies involved in BI tools include:

### Online analytical processing (OLAP)

The database technology that transforms raw data into an architecture that business analysts can readily consume.

_OLAP_ tools organize large data sets into logical components for intelligent querying and reporting.

### Querying and reporting

Data analysts create queries in a structured query language that the database engine understands, and the resulting format and amount of data returned depends on the query.

The data analyst's job is to write queries that retrieve the exact data needed for the specific report that is to be designed.

### Data mining

_Data mining_ is the process of discovering what is in the data inside of a data repository, and what the data can do for us.

In other words, what has happened and what might happen in the future.

Data mining can help us to discover actionable trends and to make predicions.

### Data visualization

_Data visualization_ is the term used for graphic representation of _structured data_.

The term structured data refers to any data that has been mined and resides in a fixed field within a record, file, or database.

### Business activity monitoring

_Business activity monitoring (BAM)_ is a type of software that can illustrate and report on a business's or industry's overall health.

It does this by showing trends, key performance indicators (KPIs), and operational/business risks, usually in real time.

### Data warehousing

A central data repository of cleansed data aggregated from many sources can be referred to as a _data warehouse_.

A data warehouse is a _relational database_, meaning it contains multiple sets of data and joins them by their related fields.

### Digital dashboards

A _digital dashboard_ is a presentation of relevant insights derived from business data.
