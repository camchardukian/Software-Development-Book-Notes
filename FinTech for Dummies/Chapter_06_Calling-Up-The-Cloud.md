# Chapter 6 — Calling Up the Cloud

## Getting to Know the Cloud

“The cloud” can be loosely defined as a collection of servers that are available off premises and accessed on demand through private or public pipes and that function without direct end-user management.

## Introducing Types of Cloud Services

A cloud service provider (CSP) often provides hosting, on-demand resourcing, data store, elasticity, network access interfaces, metered fee structures, and multi-tenancy.

The big name CSPs include Amazon Web, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

_IaaS_ is typically billed on a monthly basic based on resources used and allocated.

IaaS may offer services such as monitoring, load-balancing, encryption, monitoring, etc.

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

_SaaS_ is ideal for short-term projects and for storage/disaster recovery preparation.

It can also be good for fast deployments and unified applications such as customer _relationship management apps_ (CRMs).

SaaS may not be the best fit if you have many unique applications, or applications that require significant customization or complete control over data security and privacy.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

In _PaaS_ the provider gives not only a web server/database, but also maintains and manages all functions of the database, web server, and container services.

## Choosing Between Private and Public Clouds

In a private cloud, servers are assigned or owned by only one tenant or owner.

Management of the cloud is the responsibility of the tenant, or a third-party agent they outsource this responsibility to.

With public clouds, however, the environments may be multi-tenant.

Public clouds are also managed and maintained by the _cloud application service providers_ (CASPs).

Overall public clouds may be more affordable, but in many cases they may make it difficult to comply with data protection laws or other regulations.

### Cloud Bursting

Companies can deploy an automated listener to accommodate occasional spikes in traffic or times where additional computing power is needed.

This allows the company to perform _cloud bursting_ when additional computing resources are needed and the company is only charged when a burst occurs.

## Reviewing Data Security and Encryption

### Data

Different types of data require different policies and procedures for storage/management. Here are the standard categories of data in most companies:

- Restricted data (RD)
- Confidential data (CD)
- Private data (PD)
- Sensitive data (SD)
- Public data (PD)

### Encryption

If a company doesn’t have a security expert on payroll, they may benefit from consulting with third-party experts such as a _cloud encryption service_ (CES).

CESs can assist with encryption key management, escrow, and security controls.

Encryption is important, but it isn’t free. It requires additional bandwidth, may slow down the delivery process, and may require additional human or financial capital.

## Surveying Data States

Here are three common states in which data is vulnerable (the 3 following headlines) and ways of providing additional security (the text following the headlines):

### Data at Rest

Split data into different stores in different locations and enforce policies that dictate which individuals have access to each location.

### Data in Transit

Encryption tools such as _Transport Layer Security_ (TLS) or _Secure Sockets Layer_ (SSL) can help protect data.

_Internet Protocol Security_ (IPsec) can protect against _virtual private network_ (VPN) access.

### Data in Use

Tokenization may be helpful here, but isn’t a complete solution. Further future developments are still needed in this area.

## Considering Cloud Scalability

_Scalability_ is basically maintaining a continuous level of performance regardless of whether load requirements (such as traffic) increase or decrease.

## Understanding Cloud-based Virtualization

_Hypervisors_ are a type of _virtual machine monitor_ (VMM) that manage _virtual machines_ (VMs) and assist in the process of scaling, elasticity, and virtualization.

## Data Protection Laws

_Data protection laws_ (DPLs) exist to prevent people or entities from misusing individual’s private information.

## Data Localization Laws

_Data localization laws_ (DLLs) may require that all personal data used or owned by citizens or legal entities to be kept within that country.
