# Chapter 7 â€” Understanding Blockchain Beyond Bitcoin

## The Basics of Blockchain

Blockchain is most well known as the technology created to support the privacy, anonymity, and accuracy of cryptocurrency transactions.

The issues that kept blockchain from receiving early adoption in the finance sector are the same reason blockchain was initially created -- anonymity, transparency, and immutability.

Because of this, permissioned blockchain was created.

Permissioned blockchain adds a more traditional control layer that allows the administrator to alter protocols, limit nodes, modify the need for consensus, and provide visibility as to the identity of transactors.

### Mining and Consensus

Mining is the method used to create consensus on the Bitcoin network.

Miners are compute nodes that perform work to solve a computation which then allows them to create or add to a block in the blockchain and then be rewarded for their success via transaction fees.

Various ways of reaching consensus include _proof of work_ (PoW), _proof of stake_ (PoS), _delegated proof of stake_ (DPoS), and _proof of activity_ (PoA).

### Smart contracts and DApps

_Smart contracts_ are lines of code with rule-based structures that are part of executable programs written in blocks as part of the blockchain structure.

_DApps_ are applications that utilize sets of linked smart contracts.

### Blockchain Network Types

_Public blockchain_ -- Centralized, open, and transparent to members and validated by consensus.

_Private blockchain_ -- Participation is by invitation only and the protocol and security may be different because there is already a level of trust among participants.

_Consortium blockchain_ -- Several organizations jointly control privileges and participation.

## Discovering How Blockchain Technology Works

Blockchain technology centers around three basic principles -- decentralization, security, and transparency.

## Looking at Blockchain's Role in FinTech

Through automation, blockchain has the potential to minimize the risks of human error or malicious activities while reducing costs.
