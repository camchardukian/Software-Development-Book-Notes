# Chapter 2 — Understanding What’s Disrupting the Financial Industry (and Why)

## Providing Trust and Value

Before investing in a business customers want to know that both their investments and their privacy will be well protected.

Traditionally, financial providers were able to provide value by providing customers many options, and many different ways of receiving these options.

These days providers are also able to provide additional value if they engage in _disintermediation_ — the process of cutting out the middlemen.

## Examining the Role of BigTech

Many financial institutions choose to partner with BigTech giants whose core competencies include things the financial institution hasn’t been able to successfully implement internally.

It’s expected that BigTech will face significantly more regulation if it continues to push further and further into the area of financial services.

- Capital Markets Tech
- WealthTech
- InsurTech
- RegTech
- PayTech
- AI in Finance
- LegalTech
