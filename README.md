This repository contains notes I've taken from the books on software development I've read.

Here's how I like to take notes:

> While I'm open to reading both ebooks and physical books, I generally choose ebooks as I'm an American currently living abroad. Usually I'll open my ebook to take up about 70-80% the width of the screen. With the other 20-30% of the screen I use the MacOS *Stickies* app to jot down my notes. I don't copy-and-paste. I write everything by hand because I feel doing so helps me better retain the information. I also strive to implement the things I read into my projects at work. Whenever relevant opportunities present themselves, I try to share new ideas with my colleagues too because *well*... we are a team after all.

If you'd like to contact me or discuss any of the notes I've taken, feel free to create an issue in this repo and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Enjoy! :)
