This repository contains notes I've taken from the books on software development I've read.

Here's how I like to take notes:

> Usually I'll open an ebook to take up about 70-80% the width of the screen. With the other 20-30% of the screen I use the MacOS _Stickies_ app to jot down my notes. I don't copy-and-paste. I type everything by hand because I feel doing so helps me better retain the information. I also strive to implement the things I read into my projects at work. Whenever relevant opportunities present themselves, I try to share new ideas with my colleagues too because _well_... we are a team after all.

If you'd like to contact me or discuss any of the notes I've taken, feel free to create an issue in this repo or reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-chardukian/). Enjoy! :)
