# Chapter 1 -- Clean Code

## There Will Be Code

While the level of abstraction of our programming languages is likely to increase over time, code itself will never be made obsolete.

There will never come a time in which machines will be to do exactly what we want rather than what we instruct them to do.

## Bad Code

While good code does not guarantee a company’s success, atrociously bad code has the potential to kill a company. LeBlanc’s Law states:

> “Later equals never.”

## The Total Cost of Owning a Mess

As a codebase gets messier and messier, a given team’s productivity will steadily fall to zero.

## Attitude

It’s the responsibility of the programmers to defend the quality of the codebase and give the managers and marketers the information they need to make decisions that are educated (at least educated from a technical perspective).

## The Primal Conundrum

The author believes that the only way to go fast is to always keep our code as clean as possible.

## The Art of Clean Code?

“Good” software developers have the ability to see a messy codebase and recognize how it could be refactored for cleanliness.

## What Is Clean Code?

Poorly written code “tempts” other developers to add more poorly written code to the mess.
Clean code is not only easy to read, but also easy for others to modify for their purposes.

## We Are Authors

You can’t write more code without reading the code that’s already been written. Developers spend more time reading code than writing (perhaps by a 10:1 ratio). For that reason if you want to write code quickly, you need to learn how to make your code easy to read.

## The Boy Scout Rule

Each time you “check-in” code, it should be cleaner than when you “checked-out” the code.
