# Chapter 14 — Successive Refinement

## Args Implementation

### How Did I Do This?

The process of writing clean code is similar to the process of writing essays we learned in school.

We need to make a “rough draft”, and then proceed through a number of refinements before we can rightfully say that we are finished.

A major weakness of inexperienced developers is that they simply “get the program working”, and then move on to the next task without making any additional refinements.

## Args: The Rough Draft

### So I Stopped

If you don’t refactor difficult to read code immediately after writing it, then it’s likely you’ll spend significantly more time rewriting that code or having to try to work around it later on.

### On Incrementalism

Following a TDD approach can be very useful in ensuring that how your application behaves after refactoring is the same as how the “rough draft” worked.

## String Arguments

A large part of good software design is knowing how to create appropriate places to different kinds of code.

By creating separations of concerns, your code becomes much easier to understand and to maintain.
