# Chapter 13 -- JavaScript And The Browser

## Networks And The Internet

A _network protocol_ is how exactly communication over a network should occur. Most protocols are built on top of other protocols.

The _Transmission Control Protocol_ (TCP) is a two-way connection-oriented protocol that helps ensure reliability and the prevention of missing packets.

## The Web

_HTTPS_ is a type of encrypted _HTTP_ protocol.

## HTML

UTF-8 is a way of encoding Unicode text as binary data. The abbreviation _href_ stands for ‘hypertext reference’.

## HTML And JavaScript

We can load ES modules in the browser by giving our _script_ tag a type attribute with a value of “module”.

## In The Sandbox

_Sandboxing_ is a term used to describe the idea of isolating a programming environment so that it’s free enough to be useful, but restricted enough that it’s hopefully not able to do anything dangerous.

## Compatibility And The Browser Wars

Today’s browsers behave much more uniformly and have significantly fewer bugs than the browsers of a couple decades ago.
