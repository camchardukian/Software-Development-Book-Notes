# Introduction

Note from Cameron: I'm going to be taking notes on the 3rd edition of _Eloquent JavaScript_ which was released in 2018 it seems.

These days most of us interact with computers via visual interfaces. This wasn’t always the case, however. In the 1980s and 1990s it was more common to interact with computers using BASIC and DOS prompts.

In the intro Haverbeke suggests that internalizing program design comes from making mistakes and practice rather than being overly adherent to a list of strict rules or “best practices”.

Haverbeke also writes that a good programming language has the following characteristics:

1. It allows us to talk about the actions the computer has to perform on a higher level.
1. It helps omit details.
1. It provides convenient building blocks.
1. It allows you to define your own building blocks.
1. It makes building blocks easy to compose.

JavaScript was designed to be very liberal in what it will allow us to do. The reason JavaScript was designed in this way was so that it would be easier for beginners to make programs using JavaScript.

Whether this actually ended up being the case, however, remains up for debate.
