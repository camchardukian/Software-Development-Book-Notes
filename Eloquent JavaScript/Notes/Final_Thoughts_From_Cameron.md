# Final Thoughts From Cameron

I felt _Eloquent JavaScript_ successfully introduced a large range of topics related to JS that I wouldn't otherwise have been exposed to (such as sets and maps).

This book also forced me to develop a deeper understanding of inheritance and the prototype chain.

With that being said, I got a bit burnt out on this book after the 1st half. After doing around 20-30 exercises I just felt like going back to building my own side projects (over the last 1.5 months I've completed the first 2 projects in the [FreeCodeCamp Quality Assurance Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/)).

I also felt that this book would've been way too difficult for someone with little or no coding experience.

In several parts of the book it felt like the author was intentionally coming up with convoluted examples.

I think this book would be an excellent introduction to JavaScript for a mid or senior level developer coming from another programming language.

I definitely don't think _Eloquent JavaScript_ is the best place for a coding newbie to start though.

All in all, I can see why this book is considered a _classic_ by many JS enthusiasts. It's definitely worth reading, but I'd by more inclined to give it a "solid" rating rather than labeling it "must read".
