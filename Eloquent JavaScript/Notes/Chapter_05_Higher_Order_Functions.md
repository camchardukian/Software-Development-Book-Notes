# Chapter 5 -- Higher-Order Functions

This chapter starts with a quote that’s too good not to share here:

> “There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that
> there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there > are no obvious deficiencies.”
> --C.A.R. Hoare, 1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture

## Abstractions

Abstractions are used to hide details and give us the ability to talk about problems at a higher or more abstract level.

## Higher-Order Functions

Functions that operate on other functions are called higher-order functions.

## Strings and Character Codes

JavaScript strings are encoded as a series of 16-bit numbers which can be referred to as _code units_. Most common English characters can be referred to using a single code unit. Emojis and characters in some foreign languages, however, require the use of multiple code units in storage.
